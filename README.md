### Important Notes Here:
â€¢ All of the logic can be found in path 'src/components/Array.jsx'

~ This is all about setting our default state to an array with some string values

* The main thing point here is to copy our default string, set setStrArr and to be able to use different methods other than using [...spread operator]
via 'forloop' or higher order functions i.e 'map/forEach'
